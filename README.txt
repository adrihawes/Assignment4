[Assignment4]

1. Short Description:
   - Assignment4 is a Python application that simulates rolling two six-sided dice. It uses the `random` module to generate a random number between 1 and 12 and prints the result. The user is prompted to roll the dice again, and the process can be repeated by entering 'yes'. The application is designed for interactive use, allowing the user to experience the randomness of dice rolls.
